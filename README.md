# Lets Play Football

## CS1D Final Project - 2016
1. Made by The Brogrammer - a team of ~~five~~ three members
2. Used Qt (version 5.5) - a cross-platform application framework to provide graphical user interface in c++
3. Used Scrum - an agile framework for software development
4. Used Travis - a hosted, distributed continuous integration service during the developing process

### Description:
The application will allow football fans to plan their dream vacation using the data stores the given National Football League (NFL) infomation.

### About the Scrum process
* There were three sprints total during the development
* A total of 13 agile stories (including description, tasks, test scenarios, and story points) were writen before the software is developed
* Definition of __Done__: Completion of the user story or for the least the graphical user interface is ready for that user story

### For more details, please go to the The Brogrammer's artifacts

#### Note: Feel free to fork this project however if you're taking CS1D, I don't recommend doing that for two main reasons:
* This project uses an old version of Qt and I won't update it.
* Academic Dishonesty, resulting an F for the course.
